RoadProfile documentation
=======================================================

RoadProfile is a python package for road engineers that implements texture metrics
(e.g. MPD) and filtering techniques widely used in road related research and asset management.
See the :ref:`introduction` for a general overview of this package and general 
implementation considerations.

Note that it is *not* an introduction to the road metrics implemented here.
Familiarity with the basic concepts, measurement techniques etc. is assumed.
