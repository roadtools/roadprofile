RoadProfile documentation
=======================================================

RoadProfile is a python package for road engineers that implements texture metrics
(e.g. MPD) and filtering techniques widely used in road related research and asset management.
See the :ref:`introduction` for a general overview of this package and general 
implementation considerations. Note that it is *not* an introduction
to the algorithms implemented here. Familiarity with the basic concepts, measurement
techniques etc. is assumed.
